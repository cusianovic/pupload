Pupload is a robust open-source tool for processing user uploads. Declaratively define your pipelines in YAML, and Pupload handles the rest.  

```yaml
# Encode a video into multiple resolutions for adaptive streaming
Name: adaptive-video

Stores:
  - Name: videos
    Type: s3

DataWells:
  - Edge: video-in
    Store: videos
    Source: upload

  # Each output gets its own edge
  - Edge: video-1080
    Store: videos

  - Edge: video-720
    Store: videos

  - Edge: thumbnail
    Store: videos

Nodes:
  - ID: encode-1080p
    Uses: pupload/encode
    Inputs:
      - Name: VideoIn
        Edge: video-in
    Outputs:
      - Name: VideoOut
        Edge: video-1080
    Flags:
      - Name: codec
        Value: libx265
      - Name: resolution
        Value: 1080

  # encode-720p, encode-480p follow the same pattern
  # All run in parallel!

  - ID: thumbnail
    Uses: pupload/thumbnail
    Inputs:
      - Name: VideoIn
        Edge: video-in
    Outputs:
      - Name: ThumbnailOut
        Edge: thumbnail
```

```bash
# Testing the pipeline on machine
pup test adaptive-video --input video-in=./sample.mp4

# Creating a development server to allow your software to trigger uploads
pup dev
```

One upload, three outputs. Each node runs in parallel inside its own container, and results land in your S3 with presigned URLs.

### Why Pupload?
Most workflow engines treat files as an afterthought. Rolling your own file handling, presigned URL logic, and storage policies
across a hodge-podge of services is extremely tedious, error-prone, and unobservable.

Pupload is built around files from the start. Upload handling, artifact storage, and how your data flows between steps are treated as first-class concepts. 
You don't build:
- Upload infrastructure (presigned URLs, validation, storage routing)
- Container orchestration (lifecycle, retries, resource scheduling)
- Pipeline coordination (DAG execution, state management, artifact tracking)
- Observability (log aggregation, timeouts, error handling)
- Scaling (run cheap workers for thumbnails, expensive GPU workers for AI inference)
- Local development (in-memory testing, mock s3 stores)


### Quick Start
```bash
go install github.com/pupload/pupload/cmd/pup@latest

git clone https://github.com/pupload/examples && cd examples
pup test adaptive-video --input video-in=./sample.mp4
```
